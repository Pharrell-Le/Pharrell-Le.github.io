### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1, was one of my most memorable labs this semester. Printing a sandwich using any protein, bread, and topping in their respective order helped me understand the code structure, compiling and running the program with multiple arguments. Furthermore, this lab increased my interest in computer science as this is one of the first labs I could do without needing help from a third-party source.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1, piqued my interest because I have always wondered how the game Wordle works. The premise of the code was to siphon and filter out words from multiple text files to find one or all five-letter words. This lab showed me how to call a text file and how essential teamwork and asking for help is. In hindsight, this lab was not tricky, but at the moment, it was confusing, and I couldnâ€™t have done it without asking the right questions to the right people.


 * Lab 1
 
    Lab 1 will always have a place in my computer science career. Previously, I had never done computer science before and was incredibly intimidated by coders and the program they wrote. But Hello.cc showed me that computer science has a place for everyone. Taking coding at my own pace and learning at my own pace. Hello.cc was simple, but it shows that coding can be as challenging as needed. That sense of flexibility brought me peace of mind and will continue to reassure me going forward with my major and career.
